    <p class="second"> A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. <br> It can have between 1 and 2h nodes at the last level h. <br> A perfect tree is therefore always complete but a complete tree is not always perfect.</p>
